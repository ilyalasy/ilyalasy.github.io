Currently doing PhD at <a href="https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/">TU Wien</a>, Austria. Right now I'm completely fascinated by mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, so my research interest lies in that domain. 

I am not particularly fond of LLMs, but I feel like we've achieved something quite incredible with quite a simple technology. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to 
belittle the achievements of all these remarkable researchers, but I believe that just scaling the next token prediction is not going to lead us to the brightest future.

Anyways, I love digging around in wires & *circuits* of modern LLMs with a hope to understand their "emergent capabilities" and contribute to better architectures in the future.

Besides all that, I'm a huge nerd, storytelling enjoyer and (indie-)gamer. TTRPGs, LARPs, TCGs (mostly Magic) - you name it. I've been DMing for quite a while now - so if interested in a game - just let me know.

I also work at <a href="https://www.charismatic.ai/">Charismatic AI</a> where we use different SOTA technologies (including our own) to generate short animated stories based on your prompt. Still quite uncanny, but fun!

Feel free to reach out, would be happpy to chat about mech interp, art, music, games, singularity, anything else really too.
